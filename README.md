**1. Systematic Management System (changes)**  
There are two ways of managing version control and collaboration.  
First, **storing data as changes** to the base version.  
It basically save the difference of each version.  
Later, when user open the modified version, the system put the difference it saved to the original version and displayed to the user.  
Therefore, original version kept, and modification plus.  

Second, **storing data as snapshots**
It totally different compared to first way.  
It saved the changed version of system, not adding the changes.  
Each modified system saved just like taking snapshots of entire scene.

**2. Systematic Management System (version control)**  
It has total 3 ways. 
First, **Local Version Control**  
Put local database on only user's computer(= local computer)  
Maybe private, but impossible for many people to work together.  

Second, **Centralized Version Control**  
There are central VCS(Version Control Server), and people access to this VCS to work together.  
Possible for collaboration work, but if **VCS Shuted down, it is disaster**.  

Last, **Distributed Version Control**  
This is **Git System**!.  
Each computer has version database for cooperation work (It literally distributed).  
It is the elaborate way for sharing work.
