**1. Systematic Management System (changes)**  
There are two ways of managing version control and collaboration.  
First, **storing data as changes** to the base version.  
It basically save the difference of each version.  
Later, when user open the modified version, the system put the difference it saved to the original version and displayed to the user.  
Therefore, original version kept, and modification plus.  

Second, **storing data as snapshots**
It totally different compared to first way.  
It saved the changed version of system, not adding the changes.  
Each modified system saved just like taking snapshots of entire scene.
